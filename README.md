# PowLastLogin

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/humancopy/pow_last_login.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/humancopy/pow_last_login) [![hex.pm](http://img.shields.io/hexpm/v/pow_last_login.svg?style=flat)](https://hex.pm/packages/pow_last_login)

A [Pow](https://github.com/danschultzer/pow) extension that adds the ability to track when and from which IP address a user logged in.

You can then add to your templates a message such as:

```elixir
You last logged in <%= Timex.format!(@conn.assigns.current_user.last_login_at, "{relative}", :relative) %> from <%= @conn.assigns.current_user.last_login_from %>.
```

Time formatting courtesy of [timex](https://github.com/bitwalker/timex), thanks ;)

## Installation

Installing PowLastLogin is super simple.

Add PowLastLogin to the list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    # ...
    {:pow_last_login, "~> 0.1.1"}
    # ...
  ]
end
```

Add it to the list of Pow extensions, and if you didn't already, also the `controller_callbacks` option:

```elixir
config :my_app, :pow,
  user: MyApp.Users.User,
  repo: MyApp.Repo,
  extensions: [...PowLastLogin],
  controller_callbacks: Pow.Extension.Phoenix.ControllerCallbacks
```

And in the `user` schema file:

```elixir
use Pow.Extension.Ecto.Schema,
    extensions: [...PowLastLogin]
```

Generate the migrations, then migrate your database. This adds the login columns added to your users table.

```
mix pow.extension.ecto.gen.migrations --extension PowLastLogin
mix ecto.migrate
```

That's it :)

## Real IP

If you're behind a proxy (e.g. CloudFlare) you should use a plug (such as [RemoteIp](https://github.com/ajvondrak/remote_ip)) to get the real IP of the client.
